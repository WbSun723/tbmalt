This folder contains a toy example to transfer the ML optimized parameter from the tbmalt framework into the standard skf file that can be used by DFTB+.

build_skf.py includes the related scripts.

abcd.txt inside the ./abcd folder contains the optimized coefficients of the cubic spline interpolation.

siband.hdf contains the siband-1-1 parameter set written in hdf5.

standard.skf is the original Si-Si parameters that can be used by DFTB+.

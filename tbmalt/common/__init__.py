    """Splits a tensor into chunks of specified length.

    This function takes a tensor & splits it into `n` chunks, where `n` is the
    number of entries in ``sizes``. The length of the `i'th` chunk is defined
    by the `i'th` element of ``sizes``.

    Arguments:
        tensor: Tensor to be split.
        sizes: Size of each chunk.
        dim: Dimension along which to split ``tensor``.

    Returns:
        chunked: Tuple of tensors viewing the original ``tensor``.

    Examples:
        Tensors can be sequentially split into multiple sub-tensors like so:

        >>> from tbmalt.common import split_by_size
        >>> a = torch.arange(10)
        >>> print(split_by_size(a, [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]))
        (tensor([0, 1]), tensor([2, 3]), tensor([4, 5]), tensor([6, 7]), tensor([8, 9]))
        >>> print(split_by_size(a, [5, 5]))
        tensor([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]), tensor([5, 6, 7, 8, 9]))
        >>> print(split_by_size(a, [1, 2, 3, 4]))
        (tensor([0]), tensor([1, 2]), tensor([3, 4, 5]), tensor([6, 7, 8, 9]))

    Notes:
        The resulting tensors ``chunked`` are views of the original tensor and
        not copies. This was created as no analog existed natively within the
        pytorch framework. However, this will eventually be removed once the
        pytorch function `split_with_sizes` becomes operational.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If number of elements requested via ``split_sizes``
            exceeds the number of elements present in ``tensor``.
